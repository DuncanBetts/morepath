Automatic ordering:

extra{foo}extra before {foo}: order with prefixes/postfixes before without

{foo}-extra versus {foo}tra: order longer prefix/postfix first

{foo}x versus {foo}y: no conflict

{foo} versus {bar}: conflict

{foo:int} versus {foo:str}: conflict

something versus {foo}: order something before foo


view versus path

view should have precedence over path: problem: some steps conflicting
with view name become impossible. workaround is to contain prefix
in the view name in this case.

path should have precedence over view: problem: view need special name
to distinguish @@, always non-clean paths

if default behavior is view have priority over path, then consumer
procedure should be adjusted: try to consume view, if no view, consume
step, etc.
