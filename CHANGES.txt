0.7 (unreleased)
================

- **Breaking change**. The mount directive's behavior and behavior in
  the ``.child`` method has changed. The relevant changes are:

  * You can define your own custom ``__init__`` for ``morepath.App``
    subclasses. Here you can specify the arguments with which your
    application object should be mounted; this replaces the
    ``variables`` class attribute (which is now ignored).

    It's not necessary to use ``super()`` when you subclass from
    ``morepath.App`` directly.

    So, instead of this::

       class MyApp(morepath.App):
           variables = ['mount_id']

    You should now write this::

       class MyApp(morepath.App):
           def __init__(self, mount_id):
               self.mount_id = mount_id

  * The ``mount`` directive should return an instance of the
    application being mounted. The application is specified using the
    ``app`` argument to the directive. So instead of this::

      @RootApp.mount(app=MyApp, path='sub/{id}')
      def mount_sub(id):
          return {
             'mount_id': id
          }

    You should now use this::

      @RootApp.mount(app=MyApp, path='sub/{id}')
      def mount_sub(id):
          return MyApp(mount_id=id)

  * The ``mount`` directive now takes a ``variables`` argument. This
    works like the ``variables`` argument to the ``path``
    directive and is used to construct links.

    It is given an instance of the app being mounted, and it should
    reconstruct those variables needed in its path. If omitted,
    Morepath tries to get them as attributes from the application
    instance, just like it tries to get attributes of any model
    instance.

    So to make linking to ``MyApp`` work, you should write write this::

      @RootApp.mount(app=MyApp, path='sub/{id}',
                     variables=lambda app: dict(id=app.mount_id))
      def mount_sub(id):
          return MyApp(mount_id=id)

    Simplest way to avoid this is to name the attributes the same way
    as the variables in the paths, just like for model classes.

  * In the past if the app was mounted you'd get the mount context
    variables as extra variables in function decorated by the ``path``
    decorator. This does not happen anymore. Instead you can add a
    special ``app`` parameter to the function decorated by ``path`` and
    from it access attributes of app (under which it was mounted).

    So instead of this::

       @MyApp.path(path='models/{id}', model=Model)
       def get_root(mount_id, id):
           return Model(mount_id, id)

    where ``mount_id`` is magically retrieved from the way ``MyApp`` was
    mounted, you now write this::

       @MyApp.path(path='models/{id}', model=Model)
       def get_root(app, id):
           return Model(app.mount_id, id)

  * There was an ``request.mounted`` attribute. This attribute is now
    gone. Instead you can access the mounted application using
    ``request.app``.

  * Not a breaking change, but worth mentioning: the ``.child`` method
    on request takes the app class (or app name) as well as the
    parameters for the function decorated by the ``mount`` directive::

       request.child(MyApp, id='foo')

    As an alternative you can now instead pass an app *instance*
    (which of course takes the parameters specified in its
    ``__init__`` method)::

       request.child(MyApp(mount_id='foo'))

  Underneath, Morepath used to have a ``Mount`` class separate from
  the ``App`` classes you define. Since Morepath 0.4 application
  objects became classes, and it made sense to make their instances
  the same as the mounted application. This unification has now taken
  place. This simplifies the implementation of mounting considerably,
  while actually making available new features. This simplification
  helped to create the new ``defer_links`` directive.

- **Breaking change**. The arguments to the ``render`` function have
  changed. This is a function you can pass to a view directive.  The
  render function now takes a second argument, the request. You need
  to update your render functions to take this into account. This only
  affects code that supplies an explicit ``render`` function to the
  ``view``, ``json`` and ``html`` directives, and since not a lot of
  those functions exist, the impact is expected to be minimal.

- **Breaking change**. In certain circumstances it was useful to
  access the settings through an application instance using
  ``app.settings``. This does not work anymore; access the settings
  through ``app.registry.settings`` instead.

- ``dump_json`` and ``load_json`` directives. This lets you
  automatically convert an object going to a response to JSON, and
  converts JSON coming in as a request body from JSON to an
  object. See http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/json.html for
  more information.

- ``defer_links`` directive. This directive can be used to declare
  that a particular mounted application takes care of linking to
  instances of a class. Besides deferring ``request.link()`` it will
  also defer ``request.view``. This lets you combine applications with
  more ease. By returning ``None`` from it you can also defer links to
  this app's parent app.

- ``app.ancestors()`` method and ``app.root`` attribute. These can be
  used for convenient access to the ancestor apps of a mounted
  application. To access from the request, use ``request.app.root``
  and ``request.app.ancestors()``.

- Several generic functions that weren't really pulling their weight
  are now gone as part of the mount simplification:
  ``generic.context`` and ``generic.traject`` are not needed anymore.

- Added documentation about auto-reloading Morepath during development.

- Minor improvement in docstrings.

0.6 (2014-09-08)
================

- Fix documentation on the ``with`` statement; it was not using the local
  ``view`` variable correctly.

- Add #morepath IRC channel to the community docs.

- Named mounts. Instead of referring to the app class when
  constructing a link to an object in an application mounted
  elsewhere, you can put in the name of the mount. The name of the
  mount can be given explicitly in the mount directive but defaults to
  the mount path.

  This helps when an application is mounted several times and needs to
  generate different links depending on where it's mounted; by
  referring to the application by name this is loosely coupled and
  will work no matter what application is mounted under that name.

  This also helps when linking to an application that may or may not
  be present; instead of doing an import while looking for
  ``ImportError``, you can try to construct the link and you'll get a
  ``LinkError`` exception if the application is not there. Though this
  still assumes you can import the model class of what you're linking
  to.

  (see issue #197)

- Introduce a ``sibling`` method on Request. This combines the
  ``.parent.child`` step in one for convenience when you want to
  link to a sibling app.

0.5.1 (2014-08-28)
==================

- Drop usage of sphinxcontrib.youtube in favor of raw HTML embedding,
  as otherwise too many things broke on readthedocs.

0.5 (2014-08-28)
================

- Add ``more.static`` documentation on local components.

- Add links to youtube videos on Morepath: the keynote at PyCon DE
  2013, and the talk on Morepath at EuroPython 2014.

- Add a whole bunch of extra code quality tools to buildout.

- ``verify_identity`` would be called even if no identity could be
  established. Now skip calling ``verify_identity`` when we already
  have ``NO_IDENTITY``. See issue #175.

- Fix issue #186: mounting an app that is absorbing paths could
  sometimes generate the wrong link. Thanks to Ying Zhong for the bug
  report and test case.

- Upgraded to a newer version of Reg (0.8) for ``@reg.classgeneric``
  support as well as performance improvements.

- Add a note in the documentation on how to deal with URL parameters
  that are not Python names (such as ``foo@``, or ``blah[]``). You can
  use a combination of ``extra_parameters`` and ``get_converters`` to
  handle them.

- Document the use of the ``with`` statement for directive
  abbreviation (see the Views document).

- Created a mailing list:

  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/morepath

  Please join!

  Add a new page on community to document this.

0.4.1 (2014-07-08)
==================

- Compatibility for Python 3. I introduced a meta class in Morepath
  0.4 and Python 3 did not like this. Now the tests pass again in
  Python 3.

- remove ``generic.lookup``, unused since Morepath 0.4.

- Increase test coverage back to 100%.

0.4 (2014-07-07)
================

- **BREAKING CHANGE** Move to class-based application registries. This
  breaks old code and it needs to be updated. The update is not
  difficult and amounts to:

  * subclass ``morepath.App`` instead of instantiating it to create a
    new app. Use subclasses for extension too.

  * To get a WSGI object you can plug into a WSGI server, you need to
    instantiate the app class first.

  Old way::

     app = morepath.App()

  So, the ``app`` object that you use directives on is an
  instance. New way::

    class app(morepath.App):
        pass

  So, now it's a class. The directives look the same as before, so this
  hasn't changed::

     @app.view(model=Foo)
     def foo_default(self, request):
        ...

  To extend an application with another one, you used to have to pass
  the ``extends`` arguments. Old way::

    sub_app = morepath.App(extends=[core_app])

  This has now turned into subclassing. New way::

    class sub_app(core_app):
        pass

  There was also a ``variables`` argument to specify an application
  that can be mounted. Old way::

     app = morepath.App(variables=['foo'])

  This is now a class attribute. New way::

     class app(morepath.App):
         variables = ['foo']

  The ``name`` argument to help debugging is gone; we can look at the
  class name now. The ``testing_config`` argument used internally in
  the Morepath tests has also become a class attribute.

  In the old system, the application object was both configuration
  point and WSGI object. Old way::

      app = morepath.App()

      # configuration
      @app.path(...)
      ...

      # wsgi
      morepath.run(app)

  In the Morepath 0.4 this has been split. As we've already seen, the
  application *class* serves. To get a WSGI object, you need to first
  *instantiate* it. New way::

     class app(morepath.App):
       pass

     # configuration
     @app.path(...)
     ...

     # wsgi
     morepath.run(app())

  To mount an application manually with variables, we used to need the
  special ``mount()`` method. Old way::

    mounted_wiki_app = wiki_app.mount(wiki_id=3)

  In the new system, mounting is done during instantiation of the app::

    mounted_wiki_app = wiki_app(wiki_id=3)

  Class names in Python are usually spelled with an upper case. In the
  Morepath docs the application object has been spelled with a lower
  case. We've used lower-case class names for application objects even
  in the updated docs for example code, but feel free to make them
  upper-case in your own code if you wish.

  Why this change? There are some major benefits to this change:

  * both extending and mounting app now use natural Python mechanisms:
    subclassing and instantation.

  * it allows us to expose the facility to create new directives to
    the API. You can create application-specific directives.

- You can define your own directives on your applications using the
  ``directive`` directive::

    @my_app.directive('my_directive')

  This exposes details of the configuration system which is
  underdocumented for now; study the ``morepath.directive`` module
  source code for examples.

- Document how to use more.static to include static resources into
  your application.

- Add a ``recursive=False`` option to the config.scan method. This
  allows the non-recursive scanning of a package. Only its
  ``__init__.py`` will be scanned.

- To support scanning a single module non-recursively we need a
  feature that hasn't landed in mainline Venusian yet, so depend on
  Venusifork for now.

- A small optimization in the publishing machinery. Less work is done
  to update the generic function lookup context during routing.

0.3 (2014-06-23)
================

- Ability to absorb paths entirely in path directive, as per issue #132.

- Refactor of config engine to make Venusian and immediate config more
  clear.

- Typo fix in docs (Remco Wendt).

- Get version number in docs from setuptools.

- Fix changelog so that PyPI page generates HTML correctly.

- Fix PDF generation so that the full content is generated.

- Ability to mark a view as internal. It will be available to
  ``request.view()`` but will give 404 on the web. This is useful for
  structuring JSON views for reusability where you don't want them to
  actually show up on the web.

- A ``request.child(something).view()`` that had this view in turn
  call a ``request.view()`` from the context of the ``something``
  application would fail -- it would not be able to look up the view
  as lookups still occurred in the context of the mounting
  application. This is now fixed. (thanks Ying Zhong for reporting it)

  Along with this fix refactored the request object so it keeps a
  simple ``mounted`` attribute instead of a stack of ``mounts``; the
  stack-like nature was not in use anymore as mounts themselves have
  parents anyway. The new code is simpler.

0.2 (2014-04-24)
================

- Python 3 support, in particular Python 3.4 (Alec Munro - fudomunro
  on github).

- Link generation now takes ``SCRIPT_NAME`` into account.

- Morepath 0.1 had a security system, but it was undocumented. Now
  it's documented (docs now in `Morepath Security`_), and some of its
  behavior was slightly tweaked:

  * new ``verify_identity`` directive.

  * ``permission`` directive was renamed to ``permission_rule``.

  * default unauthorized error is 403 Forbidden, not 401 Unauthorized.

  * ``morepath.remember`` and ``morepath.forbet`` renamed to
    ``morepath.remember_identity`` and ``morepath.forget_identity``.

- Installation documentation tweaks. (Auke Willem Oosterhoff)

- ``.gitignore`` tweaks (Auke Willem Oosterhoff)
